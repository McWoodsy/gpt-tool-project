This is a basic web app I'm working on that uses JSON data provided by GPT completion calls to generate color palettes, bar charts, and tables. I'd like to add other features like graphs or pie charts, and a copywrite assistant. 

I expanded it into a Spring Boot app so that I could practice and tinker a bit more. I am also planning on implementing an interface to allow for other data sources besides the very hit and miss GPT data.
